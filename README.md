## Download
You can download the latest release of the application [here](https://github.com/Volentix/vDexNode-GUI/releases)

## Development

### Prerequisites
For the application to work, it is **recommended** to use the **YARN** package manager, however, with the **NPM**, the application will also work.

#### 1. Node.js
If you don't have Node.js installed in your system you can follow the official instructions to do that: [Node.js install](https://nodejs.org/en/)

> You can install any **LTS** or **Current** version on your machine.

#### 2. Package manager
##### Option 1: NPM
If you installed the Node.js correctly you already have the latest **NPM** installed.
##### Option 2: YARN (recommended)
###### Ubuntu
```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt install yarn
```
###### MacOS
> It is assumed that brew is already installed
```bash
brew install yarn
```
###### Other
You can follow the instructions from official website: [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

#### 3. Quasar
If you don't have a quasar installed use the following command:
```bash
npm install -g @quasar/cli
```
